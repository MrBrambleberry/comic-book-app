# Marvel API demo

The purpose of this application right now is to render content from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) using React components

## Whats being worked on right now?

As a temporary step the app currently serves static content from a local file. 

In order to render dynamic content from the Marvel API requires public and private keys which can be retrieved by [signing up to a Marvel Developer account](https://www.marvel.com/signin?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.marvel.com%2F) - this is required as the API is rate limited and subject to [terms of use](https://developer.marvel.com/terms)

The current goal is for someone with developer credentials to be able to start the application locally and see dynamic content served from the API

## Useful commands:

`npm run start` to start the app

`npm run test` to run unit tests
